/* 
# DOM is a representation of a webpage or an XML document as a tree structure.
# Each part of the document (like paragraphs, headings, images, etc.) is represented as a node in the tree.
# This tree structure allows programmers to manipulate and change different parts of a webpage 
  using programming languages like JavaScript.
# Main advantage of using DOM is to make dynamic changes in our web-pages.
